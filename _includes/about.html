        <!-- The only thing you have to edit here is the first sentence. Replace the years of experience and industry type with your own info. -->
        <p>I'm a cybersecurity professional in training, currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, with hands-on experience in network defense, incident response, Linux system administration, and SIEM log analysis.

I’m passionate about securing systems and solving complex problems, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to a collaborative, security-driven environment.</p>
